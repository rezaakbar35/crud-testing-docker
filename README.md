# ‚ú® CRUD Unit Testing, Docker, and CI/CD ‚ú®

This project primarily focuses on the development of a simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API using Sequelize. It involves implementing functionalities like finding all records, specific records, creating new ones, and soft deletes. To ensure the API's reliability, unit testing is performed using Jest.

Additionally, the project utilizes Docker for containerization, enabling the application to run consistently across different environments. The final stage involves the setup of a Continuous Integration/Continuous Delivery (CI/CD) process through GitLab. This process automates the integration of code changes, running tests, and deploying the application within Docker containers.
